      "I think they touched on it a few times in this season, but I look forward to it being fleshed out a LOT more in the books. Sansa is EXTREMELY qualified to lead, far moreso than Dany or Jon. Her manipulation of the Dany/Jon relationship undermined the power of a Queen she did not support. Her consideration of the food supplies, and the health of the Northern forces illustrates a much more keen sense of \"ruling\". Her regular talks with Lord Royce kinda hints at some willingness to learn, as well as careful and reliable choice in advisers.\n",

      "I think the seeds were all planted to show Sansa as being a very capable leader. Its just that we weren't shown enough. Despite Jon being the true heir, and a very honourable and \"good\" person... Sansa was just considerably more qualified to lead than he was.\n",
      "100% agree & it’s so shocking HBO let them do this but only rationale I can find is they must have had contractual agreements. George understandably holding his ‘baby’ close to the vest likely only gave them license in those early years (tho I’m sure he may regret that if that’s indeed the case given how arrogantly they’ve treated his story) so my guess is they had a contract that HBO couldn’t get around.\n",
      "100% agree. It was so incredibly well done, and in a way all these people being upset about Dany \"going mad\" even more amplifies the entire morale of the story. It's so clear: War is brutal and rarely justified, especially not by the type of vague reasons Dany has had (birthright etc).\n",

But they weren't. The fact that the plot has been rushed through in a tiny amount of time makes the events that make up the plot not make sense. \n",

Or maybe the delicious Sunday roast you ordered gets brought to your table, you take the first succulent bite and as you reach for another, it gets taken away and you're left with your stomach rumbling, tantalised by the thought of what could have been. \n",

Jon and Dany never had the best chemistry, they just felt forced compared to Jon and Ygritte or dany and drogo/dany and daario. That’s why (to me at least) danys death felt kind of hollow, if they took the time to build their relationship like the show has built other relationships, jon killing dany would have been so much stronger of a scene.\n",

      "In Essos she was regarded as a saviour.  To to common folk, she was the Breaker of Chains, and to the slavers, she was the Mother of Dragons.  The good people adored her and the evil slavers feared her.  It would make no sense to kill those who love her.  It gave her purpose, and a sense of pride.  She is doing something good for people who needed her.  Having her as a ruler meant no longer having to live in chains.  No longer being abused by the powerful.  They were treated as they wanted to be treated for once, human.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Westeros however, she is still only known as the daughter of the Mad King.  Because of his madness, to almost everyone, Targaryens know only fire and blood.  The common folk didn't care who sat on the Iron Throne, as long as they were not starving or being killed.  Robert was a drunk and neglected his duties and Joffrey is a bloodthirsty murdering psychopath in a child's body.  Cersei committed horrible atrocities to claim the throne, and when push came to shove, for the fate of humanity, she was a coward who thought she was smarter than her enemies.  And yet, even after being ruled by these terrible rulers, when given the opportunity to reach out to a saviour, all the common folk in Kings Landing focused on was their fear of the Dragon Queen.  This is the same queen where merely days ago, personally fought for their right to live.  She has sacrificed armies, friends died fighting with her, all for the sake of humanity, and yet at the critical moment, they chose to cower away from their saviour to wait out the war.  To these people, Cersei, Daenerys, or any other ruler sitting on the Iron Throne made no difference to their lives.  She meant nothing to the very people she gave up so much to save.  Realizing this was what tipped the madness in Dany.  If she can't win their love, then fear it is.  She said it herself to Jon.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Dany, she was never going to truly be Queen to these people, who only care about themselves.  She decided that these people where no better than ashes.  She came to Westeros to rule, not to be another poster child of the corrupt rulers before her.  If you don't love her like a Queen should be loved, she doesn't need you.\n",

      "\"While personality continues to evolve over time and respond to the influences and experiences of life, much of personality is determined by inborn traits and early childhood experiences.\" -Kendra Cherry\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "Personality, like all of psychology, is a relationship between the influence of one's environment and genetics. The old nature vs. nurture debate on what helps to cause a person to behave as they do. It is often broken down as temperament, character, and environment. I am not an expert by any means, and much of a psychologist's position on a particular phenomenon will depend on the lens in which they view it. Having said that, research has shown personality is around a 50/50 ratio depending on the study; which leads me to believe it will depend on the person how much a specific stressor will affect them. Taking this into account we can presume that Daenerys Targaryen's behavior will be influenced, partially, by her trait inheritance by way of gene expression. The phenotype (set of observable characteristics of an individual resulting from the interaction of its genotype with the environment) of a person will depend on the interaction between their genes and their environment. All of this points towards the famous line, \"The gods flip a coin to decide if a Targaryen will be mad.\" While I don't think it's accurate to say that if someone has a particular gene or set of genes that will determine they will \"be mad\" or behave violently (like some are apt to believe MAOA gene does), I don't know if GRRM is ascribing to genetics in this way. So, if Dany carries the \"madness\" gene and if her environment is optimal for this gene to express itself, then we have what we need to lead down the road to madness. I'm not a biologist so take all this as an elementary understanding of genetics coupled with what I think GRRM was trying to establish in his world building. Now on to her terrible environments and experiences.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dany was born from a place of privilege and high expectation which were both taken away at a young age. She also experienced the terrible trauma of having her family murdered and her having to leave home. During one of, if not the most critical developmental stages of life, she lived in isolation with her abusive, narcissistic, and controlling brother. In fact, she has primarily been used as a means to an end for the majority of her childhood (remember this as it crops up later). I could get into the categorical imperative and why this, in and of itself, is ethically problematic, but I'll stick with the psychology for now. All this lead up to her being sold off to a warlord so that her pretentious and entitled brother could sit on the Iron Throne. How this influences personality is one's self-image weakens; the ego becomes pliable in a manner which allows for survival — adaptation by way of accommodation to new schema events.  The extreme life stressors she experienced essentially forced her into adapting so that she could survive. Adaptation arises from the stress/coping dichotomy; this manifests as emotional changes that vary over time until a balance between the two is reached.\n",

      "\n",
      "As she learned to live with her new situation and eventually manipulate (called integration) her rapist husband she gained a sense of power; probably the first she ever truly had. This was when her character began to form a pillar of her personality. Once Dany found she was able to manipulate Drogo, she knew her brother could be cast aside and that she could sit on the Iron Throne. She gained a singular purpose that allowed for her to endure any manner of suffering. One pillar of Daenerys' personality is her entitlement to rule Westeros. Remember, she thinks she was born to rule. It is likely she believes this because this is what her society had conditioned her to think. She grew being told this every day when she was young and that she was robbed of her birthright to be royalty. Now that she believes it is a real possibility to sit on the Iron Throne it will drive different aspects of her behavior and influence her decisions.\n",

      "&#x200B;\n",

      "This leads me to another aspect of her personality; she is the mother of dragons. Time and again we are reminded she can't have kids and that the dragons are her metaphorical (and maybe in her mind literal) children. After she was \"reborn\" from the fire with her dragons, she saw her desire to rule as destiny. This belief, now a significant influencer of her personality, is solidified. The trauma of losing her husband and unborn child by the betrayal of the witch (I forget her name) lead to the decision to sit in the pyre with Drogo and her dragon eggs. Some say either Dany knew or just thought she wouldn't burn because she's a \"true dragon.\" Either way, having been reborn, and with three magical dragons no less, she is recommitted to her purpose of ascending to the Iron Throne. The names of her dragons are also telling of her personality. Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegol were all named after important men in her life. This decision shouldn't need too much explanation. She could now use these dragons as a way to fulfill her destiny.\n",

      "With her dragons in tow, she arrives at Qarth. Here, after getting inside with the help of Xaro Xhoan Daxos (future \"King of Qarth\" guy) she settles in, but all the while she is being used by different individuals for different ends. The warlocks stole her dragons, Xaro attempted to manipulate her to secure power for himself, the betrayal of Doreah (the slave girl), and in the middle of all this most of her khalasar was killed. Her being unable to protect those loyal to her will be an important point to remember because it is a lesson she doesn't forget. In fact, she learns several lessons in Qarth; that betrayal is around the corner, that she can't depend on others to give her what she wants, and that she is willing to use others as a means to an end. These frame her perspective in a negative or pessimistic manner. All of these lessons contribute to the development of her personality as a ruthlessness leader as well as to her maximizing future affordance. She becomes, at least for a time, very much a utilitarian which is sometimes criticized as being uncaring.\n",

      "In Astapor she learns what the Good Masters do to condition the Unsullied soldiers so that they have no fear and follow orders. She likely planned to free the slaves well in advance; which is why she so easily gave up one of her dragons during the deal. The plan all along was to get just enough Unsullied to overthrow the Good Masters and then take all the soldiers for her own. Dany granting the Unsullied their freedom solidified their support of her. It was a brilliant move. But, was it done out of moral responsibility or a maneuver for her to gain a supremely loyal army? At this point, she is cunning, creative, and willing to do just about anything to get what she wants. This leads to her idea to go on a slave freeing tour. I believe she may have done this to gain other followers and relish in the love they'd afford her more so than she did because it was morally justified in freeing the slaves. Skipping ahead to Meereen I will briefly bring up her experience with witnessing the crucified children and want to meet \"injustice with justice.\" She now sees herself as a liberator and a \"Miesha\" to the recently freed slaves. She is the mother of dragons and mother of freed slaves. This could also be considered a part of her personality. She considers herself morally superior (which, arguably she is in this instance), but just because she is in the right in this particular instances doesn't mean every decision is a moral right, even if the ends seemingly justify the means.

      "2) The reason he 'allowed people to die' was already covered in the first answer; if you could see that we all survive the Apocalypse, would you try to change anything at all and risk it not coming true? You've seen how quickly Gossip spreads in Westeros (RIP Varys). So, even if he knew Dany was going to go mad, it would have been a little contentious to go on telling everyone, or a few insiders that knowledge. Before long, everyone would know and two things would happen --- Dany would rebel or Jon would have had to kill Dany, as she is already paranoid and he was the only person that could have ever been tasked to do so. \n",

As such, he simply let everyone else act out of their own will, given that the only thing an individual can control is themselves --- aka the Development of his Apathy; to do otherwise, would be to risk the loss of more lives.**  While not as explicit, this last bit and most of your questions were already reasonably alluded to in my original post.\n",

      "1. In a world where murder is punishable by death, I think she was justified in executing Mirri Maz Duur. Yes, this woman had her reasons no doubt. However, she did betray Dany, a girl who was naive yes, but who genuinely wanted to help her. And this betrayal was truly horrific, Mirri cursed Dany and murdered her innocent child. Dany lost all she hold dear and was devastated. She was also shocked because in her naivety she didn't thought someone would cheat her without a motive. One can argue the witch had a reason to kill Drogo, but she had absolutely no right to murder Dany's child. **Yes, burning a person alive is not justice but I think it's understandable in the context of the story. She used Mirri's life as the witch used her child’s, it’s called reciprocal justice.**\n",
      "2. This is a problematic action from the books, but the show makes it worse, because it makes it look like Dany just chose random people to crucify. **While in the books, Dany asks for the Meereenese slavers to choose who will be crucified, and she asks specifically for the leaders, the ones most likely to have committed the crime**. In the show, Hizdahr comes to talk about how his father was a “good slaver”, and ask for the people crucified to be taken down to be buried. **In the books, no one needs to ask Dany to take down the corpses, she does it of her own volition. She actually does feel remorseful right after it.** I’m not trying to say that Dany’s actions aren’t problematic in the books, but the show does everything to paint it in the worst light possible.\n",
      "3. In the show, Dany’s dragons are easily stolen and she goes to the House of the Undying not on her own free will, but because she has no choice. Afterwards she permanently locks Xaro and Doreah in a vault. **In the books, this doesn't happen.** Dany’s motivation for entering the House of the Undying is solely to seek knowledge.\n",

      "1) I never said she didn't help. She did help, but claiming her as the savior devalues the commitment and sacrifice made by everyone else. The whole point of fight against the Night King was that people were coming together to fight for common cause. The North couldn't do it alone, and neither could Dany. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The city did surrender. That's why they were ringing the bells. The Lannister soldiers threw down their swords. The city was taken at that point. The only thing left to deal with was Cersei herself. Burning the city was completely unnecessary and unjustified. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) They were not collateral damage. Dany specifically targeted the people in the streets. If she wanted to take down Cersei, she could have flown directly to the Red Keep. Cersei's excessiveness does not justify Dany's. Two wrongs don't make a right. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The unnecessary death of innocents is never excusable. The bottom line is that Dany did not need to kill the innocent people of King's Landing, but she did anyway. That is straight-up genocide. If seeing innocent people being slaughtered was a highlight of the show for you, then you are a sadist. \n",

      "1. It doesn't matter how many times she says \"fire and blood\" or \"burning\" what matters are her actions and her actions were, kill evil enemies, save innocents. She talks about messing up her enemies but when someone tells her, but innocents will die, maybe try something else, she agrees every time.\n",

      "6. You know Jon right.. he wouldn't do such things. He would take his punishment... Like Tormund said, he want to take the wildings back the the real north, because they are like nomadic people and its not their lifestyle to settle down... Jon is only joing them. Since the Lord of Light isn't a character one the show, we don't know what he wants... Beric was brought back a dozen times for saveing Arya... so it could be possible, that Jon was brought back for uniting the wildings, north, vale and dany against the NK or killing dany...\n",
      "1) I think I made it clear, or at least I tried, that what Dany did in the past did not justify what she did to King’s Landing. When you kill hundreds of thousands of innocent people after they’ve already surrendered, yeah you reach a point of no return. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Yes, Hitler was absolutely evil when he brushed his teeth and pet his dogs because he then went to work trying to genocide Jews and others because he believed they were basically an inferior species. Spending parts of your day not explicitly planning the execution of millions of people does not make you a complicated figure that contains multitudes. If Hitler has spent his rise to power freeing the oppressed and marginalized only to turn around and genocide them, he’d be no less horrible by the end, but you’d have to reckon with his transition as a character, rather than simply stating he was evil the whole time. I still find it concerning that they can’t distinguish Hitler’s rise to power and rounding up and killing 6 million Jews with Dany helping slaves take their own freedom against oppressive masters who saw the slaves as an inferior race of people\n",
      "\n",
      "3) You quoted my post only to not refute it at all? For sure, she used charged rhetoric while she was in Essos, but she never defeated a city and then proceeding to burn hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, regardless of who they were while she was over there. Her conquests in Slaver’s Bay were largely for the explicit purpose of trying to assist slaves in taking their freedom. She, like Lincoln, used violence (with standards no worse than what was the norm in this world) to cure a genuine injustice. Slavery *is* a genuine injustice; Jewish people existing *is not* an injustice. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Even when she was in Westeros, she chooses at multiple moments not to just indiscriminately annihilate KL or any other part of Westeros, or immediately set out pillaging/raping/killing/burning across the Riverlands like the Lannisters or across the Westerlands like the Northmen. So for all of her rhetoric in Essos, at least initially, Dany was not intent on simply burning all of the people of KL just for giggles b/c “she was always a mass-murdering narcissist” or whatever. The fact is that despite Dany’s rhetoric, she never used that much violence and that indiscriminately prior to The Bells. She almost always had a specific target, against specific bad actors, and used the violence to stop a genuine and specific injustice in order to protect a marginalized group of people. \n",
      "\n",
      "5) By the time Dany is in Westeros, and particularly after the destruction of KL, it is clear how warped her thinking about goodness and injustice had become. Back in Essos she told the freed slaves that she could not give them freedom, but in the throne room, she is declaring that only she knows what is good. She could no longer define a particular injustice and prescribe a specific remedy like she could in Essos, but instead spoke in vague terms about “a better world” and made it clear that only she could be responsible for this. And in The Bells she indiscriminately murders the exact kinds of people she had spent her formative years being the champion of. You can argue that this was always her character, but the charged rhetoric she used on occasion in Essos ran counter to the actions she took, against whom, and for what purpose while she was over there\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Which all gets me back to my *initial point*; that this wasn’t a case of someone who, in retrospect, was evil the whole time. No, this was a person who, despite the occasional bit of fire & blood rhetoric, largely showed compassion and empathy for the downtrodden and used her power and violence (though no more so than was normal for this world) to help stop a genuine injustice out of a genuine sense of justice and compassion. Until, fueled by loss and betrayal and a meteoric rise in power, her own compassion and desire to have a home became corrupted into a quest for absolute power — a quest that led her to commit an atrocity that ultimately made her irredeemable. By the end, she absolutely became an irredeemable evil person, who used unimaginable and indiscriminate violence to achieve a corrupted purpose. But that does not wash out the genuinely good (with normal levels of targeted violence) things she did earlier in her arc. You can say that Dany always had a bit of Fire & Blood in her, but it is her compassion and justice that are the dominant traits that she acts upon for much of the story, until she transforms more fully in to the Fire & Blood person at the end. Basically, my argument is that she starts out as like 75% compassion & justice and 25% Fire & Blood and ends at 95% Fire & Blood and 5% compassion & justice, while lots of people no say at the end of this story “oh, she was 90% Fire & Blood the whole time”. I strongly disagree with that.\n",

      "7) AND I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH BUT HITLER HAS NO REDEEMING LEGACY. THE SINGULAR PROJECT OF HIS TIME WITH POWER WAS GENOCIDE AND AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE A MASTER RACE. HIS STORY IS DEFINITELY NOT A “GOOD AND EVIL IS A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE” STORY\n",
      "1. I thought this was a pretty heavyhanded line, because by that point in the show I thought it was well established that Jon abdicates or takes on power in order to do that most good for his people, while Daenerys does good when it consolidates her power. Even going to Winterfell, while risky, had the potential to increase her power. But now I think it was necessary because some people hadn't really thought in those terms while watching.\n",

It didnt say who will have the most power at the end of the show. It was talking about the mythical Iron Throne. What did you think? All of team nobody thought Westeros would devolve into some lawless anarchist commune? Or that Westeros would devolve into some black hole and fade from existence? No, we just simply said the symbolic Throne wont make it through the series. Obviously groups of people will always have power and somebody to a certain extent had to come out on top.

      "\n",
      "Dany isn't one to take that, and responds with: \"They eat whatever they want\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2 - Jon bent the knee. He has a duty to his Queen, and she has a duty to rule the North. Either way, Sansa has no direct reason to dislike Daenerys until she sees that she is an inappropriate ruler and isn't taking care of the North. At this point, she is the only person who can defend the North from being destroyed by the Night King.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 - Yes, Daenerys does have Dragons - but at this point, she's there to protect the North. If Sansa is happy for her to sacrifice her men and dragons to protect them, but isn't happy for her to rule the North, what does that say about her? What is her reasoning for this?\n",
      "1. It was widely known that Robert always goes 1-on-1 with spear versus the boars. No one ever said this was tried once.\n",
      "2. Arya tried to. She also tried to do it in the books, she is not some mastermind,  she is just a child, then she is mad at herself when she realizes that she blew the opportunity. Of course at first she didn't believe, so all-in-all she had 2 tries. The second try was going to reveal her to Tywin (talking about show only) and the third was to be Tywin, but then when Jaqen said that it might take him an year to do it, she named him. So the 3rd wish wasn't anyone in particular, it was just to save herself and her group.\n",

By the overnight hours of August 8th-9th the plane carrying the bomb to Nagasaki was already in the air, so only a little over 24 hours after the Japanese leadership would've learned of the nature of the first bomb. In the shock, horror, confusion, and disbelief following the first bombing I think it's pretty reasonable that they weren't able to make a firm decision to surrender in that time. The US itself had originally planned on not dropping the second bomb on the 11th to give them more time but moved it up because of bad weather. \n",

The fact that the Red Keep hadn't actually fallen is unimportant. With the city lost and her army and navy gone Cersei obviously couldn't win. It was the equivalent of being checkmated in chess; you never actually \"kill\" the king, you just make their position hopeless. In any case Dany could've easily just flown directly to the Red Keep when the bells started tolling and leveled it as she eventually did anyway.

      "\n",
      "2) The city did surrender. Furthermore, Cersei's actions do not dictate Dany's actions. They do not remove her ability to choose. Dany made her choice to do what she did. It can't be blamed on anyone other than her. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) She was only betrayed by them because she chose to see it that way. The only one who actually betrayed her out of that group is Varys. Furthermore, this is once again not a justification for genocide. The people of King's Landing didn't betray her, but yet that is who she burned. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Why do the people of King's Landing deserve to die? How could you ever call genocide the \"right\" thing for her to do? \n",
      "\n",
      "5) No, she didn't. Her armies took King's Landing. She destroyed it. Her actions were actually counter-productive to the capturing of the city.\n",
      "1. She didnt go insane. She said she chose fear. The people in Westeros didnt worship her like the people in Essos, and she couldn't tolerate that. So she chose to rule them by fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. She LOVES violence. She kills people all the time and she does it in cruel ways, and she watches. She wanted to crucify slavers (at random - so she was happy to kill innocents). She locked her handmaiden in vault. She burns people to death ALL THE TIME. She killed the Unsullied's masters in cold blood so she could take their slave army to fight for \"her\" throne and had the audacity to call herself \"breaker of chains\".\n",

      "4. The people of King's Landing were her enemy. It's been made very clear that she doesnt just want people to bend the knee, she wants to be worshipped. They were never going to worship her.\n",
      "1. She had close to no characer development in this season. Paranoia ? Yes. Madness ? No. No yeah, it was really likely that she would turn mad, but not that way, not that easily and not that quickly\n",
      "2. Dragons should zigzag. But if one can't, the other cannot either. Consistency is key. Especially considering Rhaegal got shot 3 times, 100% hit, with only a few scorpions, while Drogon went straight to the hundreds/dozens of scorpions and came out unscathed.\n",
      "1) she isn't the rightful heir by any stretch. Her line was broken when Robert Baratheon was made king. Robert's heirs should be next in succession, not her. Even if the Targaryen line was reinstated, she isn't the rightful heir because Jon is. She desperately *wants* to be the rightful heir, she's thought she was all her life, but now we're seeing that when faced with the ***reality*** that she isn't, she can't handle it.\n",

      "2) This series has always played with the values of oaths and honor. Is the oath of a kingsguard truly more important than a knight's oath to protect the innocent? Is the oath to one's word more important than the image of one's honor as lord? Jon being truthful with his family was the right thing for him to do. Like Ned, he's honorable to a fault. Was it the smart thing, or the kind thing to do? No. But it's the right thing to do. Like Ned, Jon does what he thinks is right, even when it hurts him. \n",

Burning people who could be beheaded, basically crucifying so much of the population of Meereen, burning that woman on Drogo's pyre in season 1, wanting to unleash hell on the other slaver's bay cities that fell back into slavery, etc. Showing mercy only at the behest of her advisers, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Her compassion isn't as deep as she (and those close to her) like to claim. If she really cared about innocents, she would've stayed in Slaver's Bay and tried to build a more sustainably just society. But she didn't care about them as much as she cares about her birthright. \n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Speaking of birthright, it's threatened now that Jon's secret is spreading and as it becomes more and more apparent that so many of the people of Westeros fear or hate her, and would one way or another conspire against her the second she took power. She's obsessed with her destiny - it and her friends are all she had. \n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Cities are sacked in war. It's horrific, but it's something that happens. Doesn't make it any less awful, but Dany has been a queen so long that she doubtless sees (at least temporarily) all these innocent people as the pawns of war, as hundreds of military leaders and monarch before her had. \n",

      "\n",
      "3. She's been a psycho for many, many seasons. People just didn't recognise it because she was burning slavers or dothraki lords or traitors or lannister soldiers. She's been trigger-happy with the fire for years, and all the advisors holding her back are dead or too weak to stop her.\n",

First, he holds a relationship with Brienne, which in the end served no purpose, then he rides off to save the woman he knows would behead him on sight. While I’m more mad with how they both went out than Jamie going back to her, it still doesn’t make much sense.\n",

      "Your statement on lazy fans makes absolutely zero sense, how can we be lazy when we’re not the ones making the show? What makes us lazy? And as far as Dany going mad, I and many other people would not have minded it if it actually was given more time for it to happen instead of the 5 episodes of her completely breaking character. I’m glad you enjoyed it, I wish I did, but certain things have left me unsatisfied, and I have a right to be, as you have a right to have liked the episode.\n",

      "3. I've seen multiple people who have a problem with this actually agreeing that Dany turning to the mad queen is a really good idea, but has been written so shockingly bad. \n",
      "4. It's been the most out of character moment in GoT, shes never wanted to kill innocent people. She was devastated when her dragons killed 1 child, then locked 2 of them in the dungeons because of it \n",

      "I love the concept of the mad queen, but it wasn't done right. They've rushed the entire season. That's why people have a problem with it, not because it's their favourite character.\n",

You can see the ships firing projectiles while they talk.

How their claim on the Iron Throne is right and true, and that they once had dragons, powerful ones and they were the only ones capable of handling them.  And how people would flock to her banners by both him and Illyrio, from Jorah to Tyrion. Can you blame her for not liking the chilly and xenophobic gazes given to her by Winterfell's townfolk when she comes to aid them, or blame her after losing Viserion and Jorah for this fight that her lonely celebrations make her feel unloved? Especially when everything she's fought her entire life for is literally one unwanting 'heir' away from being taken from her because Jon Snow is native and a war veteran on Westeros?

Also seriously, Daenerys came here to win a war and Jon is coming up with tales of a magical undead army about to breach into Westeros at this exact moment of time. I think anyone would be a skeptic and if you compare Daenerys and her actions with that of Cersei Lannister's prior to Jon's declaration of having bent the knee, Daenerys is a saint. She even provides dragonglass at no cost. \n",

And if I recall correctly, Jon is pulled aside by his family after this meeting and spills the beans about being Aegon. Daenerys pushing for Jon's forces to honor their agreement and march early can also be contributed to 'I need to act fast, or the North might put Jon there over me, despite him not even wanting it and swearing fealty.'\n",

      "1) Win a city, lose the war. The people of King's Landing didn't cry out for her rule when she arrived with dragons and armies. They didn't cry out against Cersei when she tried offering a peaceful surrender. It took until the city was half in flames before the Westerosi accepted her. She could take the capital now, but the rest of the people would continue rejecting her rule, especially with another option like Jon on the table.\n",

      "Abolishing hereditary monarchy in favour of pseudo-democratically elected (by a dozen high lords) monarchs is terrible and literally a step back in progress. It’s Rome all over, for a time the Senate elected Caesar and things worked all right, until someone decides to use his leverage to get his son elected and then his son and his son do the same and suddenly it’s a dynastic monarchy that abolishes the ruling council. Also the high lords of Westeros are of course inclined to pick a king like Bran, not because he has a unifying story but precisely because he’s a weak, impotent monarch who will allow them to take back control of their own domains. Maybe that’s good for some kingdoms but the Reach is now ruled by an up-jumped cutthroat who probably can’t read and is generally completely uneducated and will use violence to coerce his subjects into making him even richer and more powerful and whatever potentially benign neglect could have come from it all conveniently sidesteps the likelihood of at least a half dozen bloody wars of succession in the kingdoms since Tyrion is maybe no longer a claimant to Casterly Rock and unclear about whether he’s going to marry and father heirs and the rest of House Lannister appears to be extinct, House Baratheon was already extinct in the male line until the queen that never sat on the throne said that Gendry was the lawful son of Robert (though if memory serves Edric Storm is older than Gendry and he actually was raised in Storm’s End), House Arryn has always had a notoriously hard time producing heirs and there are plenty of reasons to question the parentage of Robert Arryn (or is he Robin in the show idk, either way there’s a strong possibility that he’s Littlefinger’s bastard & not Jon Arryn’s son at all), Bronn is literally an up-jumped cutthroat with no claim to anything while House Florent actually had a stronger claim to Highgarden than House Tyrell (through the former Kings of the Reach, House Gardener) and now that House Tyrell is apparently extinct and House Florent is apparently not extinct they’re not going to follow a fucking cutthroat with no claims when they had stronger claims than their last liegelord, there’s little justification for the Riverlands to actually back Edmure since he was locked in a dungeon for the whole fucking war and they declared Robb Stark their king and all of this is leading back to the fundamental problem that Bran is a weak monarch and the high lords want a weak monarch but they also maybe/probably can’t hold their own domains and are looking down the barrel of 12 different succession crises and succession crises basically always lead to war. Then there’s the secessionist aims of Dorne and the Iron Islands and the likelihood of war over the fact that the independent Kingdom of the North and the (soon to be independent) Kingdom of the Iron Islands both claim the Riverlands by right of conquest (the fucking Riverlords named Robb Stark King of the Trident like five minutes ago ffs) and even if it doesn’t happen in this generation, it will happen within a few generations that either or both of them will try and conquer the Riverlands back. Oh and what happens when Jon Snow—who’s clearly fucked off to be King Beyond the Wall rather than a member of the now pointless Night’s Watch again—has sons who come South eventually (or their sons or their sons’ sons who fucking cares) and claim the crown as the last Targaryens? Putting Bran on the throne basically ensures that all of those scenarios are possible & likely. But hey who cares because “Bran the Broken” for king has a cute ring to it.\n",

      "\n",
      ">Once Upon a Time doesn't have a story, it has a backstory. Game of Thrones is the observation of events in a more complex universe. Game of Thrones doesn't have a protagonist because it's about its universe and politics, not a personal adventure. The conflicts are much bigger than the characters. Anyone can live them. In Once Upon a Time, women have power. Conflicts will always orbit them. In game of thrones, who has the power has power. The justice system here is a playground for the big players to fight. In Once Upon a Time, characters are not what they sound. Everything is two-faced. Every story is double: kid has two mother, the true and the stepmother. The most important statement is to praise love: if you have it, you win. In Game of Thrones, love is nothing. Duty, power and self-love are all that matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saying the show is about politics is not saying the fantasy is not important within the series or boring. The fantasy is the ambience where everything will happen, but it's not the center. And contributes to make this even more interesting.\n",
      "Picture it as a paper. You draw a big map over all of it. The map name is fantasy. It's appealing, it's intereting, it's fun. But the X is the characters' actions and reactions while fighting for power in that wondrous world with wondrous tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fantasy is just a genre, not a theme. Lord of the rings is about friendship and hope, The hobbit is about home and greed, Once upon a time is about love, Little red riding hood is about thuth, D&D can be about anything the players want... All of them are fantasy stories, each with a different theme.\n",

      "\n",
      "About Bronn. Who else made more money/property during the show than he did? So, if someone knows how to make money, and to double his gain, and to make money flows, he does. Also, he said earlier that he doesn't understand the concept of loan. Unlike Littlefinger, who pushed 7k into a  tremendous debt.\n",

It was the only thing to do.” AND THEON SAVES HIS BROTHER 😭 I didn’t register all of that when it was happening the first time but damn if it didn’t give me some feels on that rewatch. I loved his arc.\n",

      ">Daenerys survived by clinging with all of her strength to one essential belief - that she was destined for greatness\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd argue that she believed she was little more than an object/chattel (in the background before her story begins).\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironically, the trade to Drogo is what started her journey to \"wokeness\". As a side note: interestingly, as much as the Dothraki are a kind of \"oriental\" stereotype (MiddleEast-Mongol-AsianContinent amalgam), there's one observant/subtle undercurrent in the Dothraki storyline that deserves recognition: the strong Asian tradition that \"man and woman together hold up the sky\". (Dany's transformation into Khaleesi is a kind of growth/development from a foreign object/possession into a respected partner on a par with Fa Mulan [the real version] or the golden phoenix of the Bright Pearl fairy tale. It's an aspect of \"the orient\" that doesn't often get played in western film/media, which likes to depict Asia as depraved/misogynistic. But I'm going off on a tangent.)\n",

He thus burns the letter, and tells Dantes to deny its existence.\n",

This would have completely been in character of her going directly toward Cersei and destroying the place that has brought her family so much pain. However going to murder children on the other hand is not something I could ever see her doing. This is the same girl who took all of those children slaves off their stakes and buried them in the road to Meereen. If they wanted to show her descent into madness we needed it to be done over more then a few episodes. Just because they had foreshadowing back in previous seasons doesn’t mean that is what her character. You need actual development to get her character towards wanting to kill innocents which is something she has always tried to avoid. She also didn’t think those members of the families were innocent which is something she struggled with that season.\n",

He is surrounded by free children, by free men and women, he will be forever free, he can find more frends, a love, and I think he can have children too, because the true north is not only beyond the wall but also beyond any type of chains. This was made clear during last minutes of the show, you can see him smiling (he made more smiles whe beyond the wall than elsewhere I guess), you can see him happy to stay with Ghost, with Tormund. He definitely is not suitable for the life south of the wall. The true north is his home, he is back home.\n",

      "Absolutely did. But whatever\n",
      "Absolutely don't understand complaints about Jaime's arc. He took his time off from his beloved bitch fucking with his second love, drinking with friends, fighting the undead. But what he was supposed to do after all that? Of course returning to his ex is completely logical.\n",

      "Absolutely. Even if it was a tavern outside Winterfell, I'm unconvinced, the whole farce the they would just give up a castle that easy is ridiculous. Bronn has no leverage. His only leverage was pointing a cross bow at Tyrion. \n",
      "\n",
      "Why on earth would Tyrion keep his side of the deal when he just threatened to kill him and then he refuses to fight with them.\n",
      "Absolutely\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the actors clearly aren't comfortable with things. They've all winced when asked about it.\n",
      "Absolutely fine relative to any other ruler in westeros. Dany has always been ruthless to people who have wronged her, but so has any other apparently sane ruler in westeros. To name a few: Tywin lannister was far more ruthless than Dany has ever been (until tonight). Robb Stark executed his one of his biggest bannermen against the wishes of all his advisors and his own mother. Ned Stark has beheaded more people than we can count. He didnt even listen to the Knights watch guy who saw the WW back in season 1. Jon Snow has killed a little boy. Ellaria sand poisoned an innocent little girl and Stannis BURNED his own daughter. Of course, we can't forget Joffrey who killed pretty much anything, and Cersei who amongst other things has killed babies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are they all mad?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dany has been the most consistently good ruler throughout this series (with the exception of Jonny Boy, and a few other people) All her punishments were not without cause. Every single example you mentioned was because someone had either tried to hurt her or her dragons. She had always had a love for the common folk. She even locked her dragons in dungeons because she thought they had killed some shepherds boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then this season within one episode she starts indiscriminantly killing innocent civilians. It just doesn't fit with her character development.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's what I'm trying to get at.\n",
      "Absolutely fine? She took glee in her brother dying, she burned the witch who \"saved\" her husband, she locked the man who took her dragons in a vault with her former handmaiden, she crucified the slave owners, she exiled and threatened to kill Jorah because she found out he was sent to kill her (but instead saved her), she burned the Tarley family to death, and she required everyone bend the knee of die. She has been extremely vengeful this entire series. She has only been nice to those who give her absolute loyalty.\n",

      "Absolutely garbage.\n",
      "Absolutely great job outlining this I completely agree... Kind of lol. So I think it's just me being optimistic and liking a nice happy ending but this is also setting up her to show that she isn't the mad queen especially after all she's lost in the last two episodes it looks almost certain that she is or has become the mad queen but I'm holding out hope that won't happen\n",
      "Absolutely. Great taste but awful execution.\n",

      "I'm not being sarcastic. He was literally the absolute best actor on the show.\n",
      "Absolutely hate the fact she did nothing and became queen in the north\n",
      "Absolutely. He even tells him that they shall speak about it next time they are together.\n",
      "Absolutely ... he's been the boogie man for the past 8 seasons and we really didn't get much about him other than he was pissed that the children of the forest made him what he was. Lame. Also he was defeated WAY too easily.\n",
      "Absolutely, he took a very dark turn at the end, it looked clear to me that he had played a very deliberate and cold blooded game. Thought it was interesting that his style of governing was essentially the same as Robert's though - let the small council deal with the day to day stuff that actually matters to people while the ruler spends his time hidden away doing his hobby - Robert had drink and whores, Bran has history channel and VR crow drone racing.\n",
      "Absolutely!  He wasn't the spider for nothing!  He knew he would be executed for treason but set the wheels in motion as quickly as he could.\n",
      "Absolutely. His entire expression changes when she says it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think they were trying to convey that Jon knew all along what he had to do, but was trying everything and anything to keep him from having to do it. He came into that throne room with 2 options. Save her from herself or kill her. \n",
      "\n",
      "When she said that line, his face changes completely. She had him thinking that the Dany he loved and respected was still in there somewhere and he could bring her back - When she said that they don't get to choose, he knew she was beyond saving.\n",
      "Absolutely. His talk with Brienne in the dragonpit was very divorced parents talking about their daughter. Except instead of talking about her soccer team, they talk about how good she is at fighting.\n",
      "Absolutely- how do you top the bloodline? Massacre 10,000s of people\n",
      "Absolutely, however there is plenty of fair criticisms for certain characters. Overall last episode was really good though imo\n",
      "absolutely how I understood that scene too OP. Dont worry about the crying children in this sub *prepared for downvotes*\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with you here. He was the face of Westeros in that scene. And he was clueless what was going on. The only thing he knew, as you said, is that she wasn't done.\n",

      "The Queen, who looked at Westeros as her home, brought armies of savages and trained killers into the country he knew and spoke in a tongue that he didn't know. Scary stuff.\n",
      "Absolutely, I feel like every single one of these actors poured their being into their character. Especially when you consider that they didn't know how their arc was ending until, well, the end.\n",
      "Absolutely. If they weren’t wiped out I’d def want Margery to end up on the iron throne.\n",
      "Absolutely. If you gave it 2-3 more hours even, just 2 episdoes! If you had another breather episode showing Dany being beset, allowed to ruminate and shown how all the scheming against her is making her crack. You get one good episode of that and allowing Emelia to really bring that to life, it would have worked much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead you get some fairly cheap if \"cinematic\" tension waiting for the bells to ring, watching her with this weird half blank/half vaguely angry look for a few minutes and then just nothing.\n",

      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "The only other thing this season we see is some weird \"I am clearly paranoid\" looks she gives at the winterfell party and one throw away line each episode. They just totally removed any semblance of the thoughtfulness that made the show great before. Its not a wonder the guys that wrote \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" allowed this to be the ending.\n",

      "\n",
      "Having that Targaryan temper wasn't the question. The issue is just how absurdly rushed things were when 2 episodes could have very easily made this all work gracefully and honestly have been a better send off for the actors that worked their asses off to bring these characters to life.\n",

      "The poor bastard that played Euron signed up to play the badass scary Euron from the books, not frat boy Euron.\n",
      "ABSOLUTELY. I kept waiting for it. OK, he's going to stab him in the back when they hug. OK, he's got Bronn outside waiting to ambush him. OK, he's following him down to the lower levels and will kill both siblings once they're together. Hey, wasn't there a prophecy about that?\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, well at least now Arya will come out of the shadows and kill Jaime and Cersei. OK, well Arya is using her training we spent season after season on, and is actually disguised as Tyrion to kill Jaime and Cersei. Hey, didn't she have a list or something?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nope, after all that build up it turns out Tyrion is not the clever mastermind who once saved King's Landing. Nope, after all that build up it turns out Arya is not No One. He's a dopey emotional mess making poor decision after poor decision, and she's just a scared little girl. Don't even get me started on her calling out \"Sandor.\"\n",
      "Absolutely! I love the set up of your scene and would have been more tense. Add the music and oh man!\n",
      "Absolutely. I'm gonna go with the latter. Either that or we get a democracy/ something King Arthur style with the knights of the roundtable. Jon would be King Arthur with Tyrion, Davos, Sansa and others helping him rule.\n",
      "Absolutely incredible. Both concept and drawing. I would love to get something like this as a tattoo.\n",
      "Absolutely. In many ways Jon will live out his days happier and more content than any character in the story. He set the world in balance now his watch has ended.\n",
      "Absolutely!\n",

      "I see where I erred: The toxicity and vitriol to which I was referring is when it is aimed at the fellow humans. The comment I quoted was focused somewhere else. Apologies.\n",

      "Absolutely, I think we agree :)\n",
      "Absolutely! I thought at that moment, Cersei was truely scared and felt extreme loss. Thats 100x better than seeing another person burnt alive.\n",
      "Absolutely!  I thought the same thing with aspects of his performance during the Cleganebowl, especially when he starts huffing for breath/kind of crying after being thrown down, and when he says \"fucking die!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Glad I'm not the only one who feels this way about him.  Truly a knockout performance\n",
      "Absolutely. It is known that George told them the ending to the show. The ending of the show is George's. The route to get there is David and Dan's.\n",
      "Absolutely. It's also something one has to learn after starting weight-lifting and getting stronger. You can't just go full force when fooling around with friends\n",
      "Absolutely, it’s entirely absurd that this is the solution. GRRM studies history, and I certainly hope that the ending for the books will be wiser than what was done on the show. \n",
      "\n",
      "What should have happened is Westeros’ version of the Magna Carta Libertatum. Granting privileges and rights to individuals and giving the noble class more power, while restricting the powers of the sovereign monarch. \n",

      "The writers really didn't do this great ending justice with the shitty development, or the lack of it.\n",
      "Absolutely, it's such a  disappointing rushed mess. If D&D didnt want to stick around to see the show through to the end someone else shouldve stepped in.\n",
      "Absolutely. I was 100% behind NK going to King’s Landing. Sure it would have been fun if he had, but that was just a crazy theory. I never wanted anyone specifically for the throne. Just a good story.\n",
      "absolutely.  I was mostly focused on the NK and the fact he didn't really have a fight.  In my scenario the only extra death is Brienne, but I felt that would be enough to shake Jamie to his core.  which might give him enough hopelessness to explain him going back to Cersei.\n",
      "Absolutely. I went into way bigger detail in another thread but I have been convinced there would be a slaughter since 2014. \n",
      "\n",
      "GRRM loves to give us a sweet story and run a blade right through its chest.\n",
      "Absolutely.  I wonder if she'll fall into a depression once the impact of what she did sets in, or if she's just full blown cuckoo now.\n",
      ">Absolutely.  Like I said about other episodes, it isn't the major points that bother me it's the little details along the way.  I don't mind Arya being the one to kill the NK with her cool ambidextrous dagger maneuver, it was that there was no fight with the NK at all.  He's the big bad for 7.5 seasons and then he doesn't even have a fight scene.  Or I don't mind that Viseryon was killed by the scorpions, (they had to show that those weapons were capable of killing a dragon before the battle at KL) but 3 impossible shots with 100% accuracy, then they can't hit another target at all.    \n",

      "Absolutely-manufactured hate is incredibly real and it gets super annoying real fast\n",
      "Absolutely. Most of the characters final moments will have been his ideas, like jaime and cersei and jon and dany\n",
      "Absolutely! Nails the likeness and makes it conceptually interesting. Check out his other work when you get the chance, he doesn’t disappoint\n",

      "The writing is paper thin.  It feels like a different show.  You can realize that now and you'll realize it then\n",
      "Absolutely not, what is £100 compared to the excitement of a new secret episode of my favourite tv show? Even though your points do make sense, I'm 99.99% convinced there's no new episode airing tonight, or ever. But that 00.01% is driving me crazy.\n",
      "Absolutely. Now it will only exist in our minds as what could have been...\n",
      "Absolutely one of the cringiest aspects about this dumpster fire. \n",
      "\n",
      "WHAT\n",
      "Absolutely outstanding artwork.\n",
      "Absolutely. People are spoiled rotten sometimes and still find something to complain about. I loved the final season. I know the reasons behind why it may have been pushed to an ending and I'm fine with that. Sad it ended but I'm sure we will see more of Westeros in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "People all had their own theories lined up for the conclusion and are salty they didn't get it right. We can theorise all we like about Bran's intentions and who he really is but that's all they are, theories. I love how the writers have left it open to our own interpretation. Seriously, some people need their dinner cooked for them and then cut up too. Be thankful we got what we got. This series has set a new benchmark in TV and we will all be the richer for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all the idiotic vitriol online from spoiled brats this season, makes me realise why we can't have nice things. These people....if someone gave them a new sports car they'd complain it's not the right model or right colour. Be thankful.\n",

      "\n",
      "Even if you disagree with me, you can't say it's \"perfect in every way.\"\n",
      "Absolutely. Remember when Bran looked back at the creation of the Night King? He saw a terrified First Man who was stabbed in the heart by an ice shard by the Children of the Forest.\n",
      "absolutely right.\n",
      "Absolutely right.\n",
      "Absolutely. Said it out loud when they were showing her face in perfect profile. Disappointed when she turned and was fine\n",
      "Absolutely said this to my wife while it happened.  And yes, the goddamn dragon understood it, so why couldn’t anyone else?\n",
      "Absolutely - she always gave me the creeps.  I think if she hadn't been blonde and beautiful, more people would have noticed earlier, too (in the show as well as among the watchers!).\n",
      "Absolutely. She lost her mind and went into complete fascist mode. Once you become a genocidal maniac, there's really no turning back.\n",
      "Absolutely. She's as bad as Cersei in my opinion.\n",
      "Absolutely. So many people who wish to defend the show keep harping on. \"Foreshadowed!\" \"Dany was always going to be the mad queen!\" When I find almost nobody actively denying that. The issue is completely the journey and how rushed it has been. Not the destination. The actual buildup completely ruined the emotional payoff.\n",
      "Absolutely stunning. Beautiful work.\n",
      "Absolutely stunning. Maisie Williams needs to see this.\n",
      "Absolutely. Sucks because his acting was pretty good.\n",
