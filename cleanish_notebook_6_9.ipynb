Do not forget that Trump owns this shutdown.

       " \"Let's pretend everything he said was true, and it made sense to take at face value. By that, I mean that a wall actually is going to stop us from spending $500 billion annually on fighting drugs, and it is going to raise wages for African Americans and latinos, and it is going to save thousands of lives, and it was supported by the Dems before Trump was president, and Mexico's paying for it indirectly, and it'll prevent thousands of women from being raped on their trek to America, and it'll put a dent in human trafficking, and it will cause the break up of gangs. \\n\\nIf that were the case, then the only reasons that people oppose it are because they hate Trump more than they like all of those benefits, or they rely on illegal immigration for votes, or they're afraid of looking racist.\\n\\nAnd that's what Trump's base believes.\\n\\nThat's what's so concerning about all of this. A huge portion of the US population thinks that we've got a magic answer to all of our problems, and all the experienced experts in political science, public policy and law are all arguing in bad faith against it. They think the only public figure arguing in good faith is Donald Trump. Trump, the billionaire real estate mogul, the serial adulterer, the 5 time WWE Smackdown participant, the ex-host of the apprentice, the person who created the conspiracy theory that Obama is Kenyan, the man that said he'd date his daughter if they weren't related, the man who wouldn't honor the veterans on the 100th anniversary of the end of WWI, the man who is at the center of at least 5 criminal probes. \\n\\nI've gone on too long at this point, but it's just utterly baffling to me and it underlies a serious problem that will continue even after Trump leaves office. It's hard to even analogize the depth of the issue, but I'll kinda try. It's like if 40% of the population thought Transformers 2: revenge of the fallen, was the most important cinematic achievement of the last 100 years. No one can actually explain to them why that's wrong. Its just too damned wrong to even know where to begin.\"]"
